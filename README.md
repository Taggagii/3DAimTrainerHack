## Notes
Note that some of the values in the code are dependent on your mouse sensitivity I've tried to comment on most of them with a `# NOTE` comment. Though I may have missed some.

Also, the python files have an extension `.py37` which is just an extension I use to remind me that something needs to be run with `python3.7`
